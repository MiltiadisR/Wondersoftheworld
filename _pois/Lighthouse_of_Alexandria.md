<p>The <strong>Lighthouse of Alexandria</strong>, also known as the <strong>Pharos of Alexandria</strong>, was a marvel of ancient engineering and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It stood as a towering beacon on the small island of Pharos, which was connected to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Constructed during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, around 280 BC, the lighthouse was designed to guide ships safely into the bustling port, known for its significant trade and commerce. The project was attributed to the ingenious Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus, and its purpose was to prevent shipwrecks in the treacherous waters near the harbor entrance.</p>

<p>This architectural masterpiece reached an estimated height between 100 and 130 meters (330 to 430 feet), making it one of the tallest structures of the ancient world. Its primary innovation was a combination of an enormous open flame and a polished bronze mirror, which created a powerful concentrated beam of light that could be seen from great distances. This made it an invaluable aid to navigation for sailors approaching the busy port, ensuring safe passage through the otherwise perilous waters.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria also housed an impressive statue, often believed to represent either Zeus or Poseidon, adding to its grandeur. This colossal statue, estimated to be around 7 meters (23 feet) in height, was crafted by the renowned sculptor Bryaxis. It served both as a symbol of the city's wealth and power and as an additional guide for mariners.</p>

<p>Despite its acclaim and utility, the Lighthouse of Alexandria met its demise due to a series of earthquakes between 956 and 1323 AD. Over time, the structure gradually crumbled, eventually disappearing beneath the Mediterranean waves. Its legacy, however, lives on through its enduring influence on lighthouse design and its symbolic significance in maritime history.</p>

<p>Today, the term "pharos" has become synonymous with lighthouses in many languages, a testament to the lasting impact of this ancient wonder. While no physical remnants remain, the Lighthouse of Alexandria remains a testament to human ingenuity and the enduring quest for maritime safety.</p>
