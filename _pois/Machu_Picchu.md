<p><strong>Machu Picchu</strong> is an ancient Incan citadel nestled in the Andes Mountains of Peru. Situated at an altitude of approximately 2,430 meters (7,970 feet), it is renowned for its breathtaking panoramic views and sophisticated dry-stone construction. This archaeological marvel is believed to have been constructed in the 15th century, during the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui.</p>

<p>The architectural brilliance of Machu Picchu is exemplified by its precisely cut stones, a hallmark of Incan construction. The site is divided into two main areas: the agricultural sector, featuring terraced fields, and the urban sector, with temples, plazas, and residential buildings. Its exact purpose remains a subject of scholarly debate, with theories ranging from a royal estate to an astronomical observatory or religious sanctuary.</p>

<p>Machu Picchu holds immense cultural significance as an emblem of the Incan Empire's advanced engineering and architectural prowess. It was built using a technique known as ashlar masonry, where stones are cut to fit together without mortar. The citadel's strategic location and its alignment with astronomical events also suggest its role in Incan cosmology and rituals.</p>

<p>Although never completely forgotten by locals, Machu Picchu remained largely unknown to the outside world until its rediscovery by American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. The site's breathtaking beauty and historical significance led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.</p>

<p>Today, Machu Picchu is one of the most visited tourist destinations globally, drawing millions of visitors annually. To protect the site's fragile ecosystem and archaeological treasures, visitor numbers are regulated. Ongoing efforts are also directed towards the conservation and restoration of Machu Picchu's structures, which have been subjected to natural wear and tear, as well as the impact of tourism.</p>

<p>Notable structures within Machu Picchu include the <strong>Inti Mach'ay</strong>, a cave believed to have served as a ceremonial space, and the <strong>Temple of the Sun</strong>, which is aligned with the solstices and equinoxes, showcasing the Incas' remarkable astronomical knowledge.</p>

<p>Access to Machu Picchu can be achieved by train or through the famous Inca Trail, a multi-day trek that offers stunning vistas and a sense of the ancient pilgrimage undertaken by the Incas.</p>
